# Holberton School Zero Day
A zero-day (also known as 0-day) vulnerability is a computer-software vulnerability that is unknown to, or unaddressed by, those who should be interested in mitigating the vulnerability (including the vendor of the target software) and is being actively exploited in the wild. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can continue to exploit it to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network.[1] An exploit directed at a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.
